## 👋 Hey there, I'm Adrianno

I’ve built innovative products across different industries, from large enterprises to early-stage startups. Now I’m circling back to where it all started: re-learning the craft of software engineering.

Currently, I’m a **Staff Product Manager @ [Pipefy](https://www.pipefy.com)**, building an AI-powered platform that automates real-world workflows.

On the side, I’m diving into **AI agents for productivity**, experimenting with Python, TypeScript and digging into the magic behind LLMs.

Feel free to reach out, my DMs are always open. 🤝
