## 👋 Hey there, I'm Adrianno

I’ve built innovative products everywhere from enterprise giants to scrappy startups and now I’m circling back to where it all started: **coding**, re-learning the craft of software engineering.

Currently, I’m a **Staff Product Manager @ [Pipefy](https://www.pipefy.com)**, building an AI-powered platform that automates complex, real-world workflows.  

On the side, I’m diving into **AI agents for productivity**, experimenting with Python, TypeScript and exploring the magic under the hood of LLMs.  

Feel free to reach out, my DMs are always open. 🤝
