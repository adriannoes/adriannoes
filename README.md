## 👋 Hey there, I'm Adrianno

I’ve built innovative products across different industries, from large enterprises to early-stage startups. Now I’m circling back to where it all started: re-learning the craft of software engineering.

Currently, I’m a **Staff Product Manager @ [Pipefy](https://www.pipefy.com)**, building an AI-powered platform that automates real-world workflows, empowering humans with AI agents.

On the side, I’m diving into **the magic behind LLMs**, experimenting with Python and TypeScript.

Software is eating the world. AI is eating software. **It’s time to build**.

Feel free to reach out, my DMs are always open. 🤝
